# RISC-OS-Community on GitHub
This is a project to collect, develop, restore, preserve and improve code and software written for the RISC OS Operanting System in the form of Open Source projects.

## Goals
1) Porting Open Source libraries and code from other Operating Systems to RISC OS
2) Create coding tutorials with practical examples to help people who are interested to learn how to code on RISC OS
3) Help RISC OS to become more and more a fully Open Source platform
4) Increase the things that can be done on the historical OS written by Acorn Computers back in the 80s for the ARM CPU and still maintained and improved to this date by RISC OS Developments and RISC OS Open organisations.
5) Have fun coding and spreading the fun to new generations interested in learning about this OS
6) Helping professionals to deliver better software on RISC OS so that the user base can enjoy more powerful and features-rich applications
7) Collect and preserve old code for RISC OS and modernise it to run aon newer release as well as being distributed via RiscPkg
8) Follow best standards and guidelines to ensure best quality possible and highest degree of security achievable on RISC OS platform

## Who is it for?
This community is for everyone interested in RISC OS, ARM and Open Source.

Everyone can join and be part of it, not just developers.

If someone needs to fix something and is not part of the community, that is OK too. but make sure you follow our contributing guidelines and you run tests before you open a PR. If you are adding code/features make sure you also add tests to test your feature.

## How does it work?
It's simple, all projects are publicly discussed. When tasks are decided they get assigned to one of the following teams:

1) Admins Team
2) Automation Team
3) Code review Team
4) Dev Team (Development Team)
5) Docs Team (Documentation Team)
6) Graphic Design Team
7) Sound Design Team

Whoeever is available in the appropriate team can pick up the task and work on it.

To work on a task make sure you read the Contributing guidelines you'll find in each project.

If one is not part of the community and still wants to take a task, just tag the corresponded issue, so we know you are working on it, fork the repo, do your changes following the contributing guide and then submit a PR for review. Before opening a PR make sure your changes pass the old tests and make sure you ad dnew tests for us to verify your changes please.

## How to submit my old code?
Read the Example Repository instructions you can find [here](https://github.com/RISC-OS-Community/ExampleRepository)

## How do to join?
Have a look at the [Contributing document here](./CONTRIBUTING.md) section "How to join"

The Contributing doucment can be found also in each project as well. 

Before you decide to join or to contribute make sure you have read and accept the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which we all have to follow to ensure a safe and happy community :)

Thanks for reading and for your interest in Open Source and RISC OS!
