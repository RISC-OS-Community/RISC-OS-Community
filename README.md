# RISC-OS-Community on GitHub
This is a project to collect, develop, restore, preserve and improve code and software written for the RISC OS Operating System in the form of Open Source projects.

## Goals
1) Porting Open Source libraries and code from other Operating Systems to RISC OS
2) Creation of coding tutorials with practical examples to help people who are interested in learning to code on RISC OS
3) Help RISC OS become a more fully Open Source platform
4) Increase the things that can be done on the historical OS written by Acorn Computers back in the 80s for the ARM CPU and still maintained and improved to this date by RISC OS Developments and RISC OS Open organisations
5) Have fun coding and spreading the fun to new generations interested in learning about this OS
6) Helping professionals to deliver better software on RISC OS so that the user base can enjoy more powerful and feature-rich applications
7) Collect and preserve old code for RISC OS and modernise it to enable running on newer releases as well as being distributed via RiscPkg
8) Follow best standards and guidelines to ensure best quality possible and highest degree of security achievable on RISC OS platform

## Who is it for?
This community is for everyone interested in RISC OS, ARM and Open Source.

Everyone can join and be part of it, not just developers.

It isn't required to be a community member to submit fixes and/or new features. However, any fix and/or new feature contributions should follow our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md). For further information [see the section below](#ok-but-what-if-i-want-to-do-a-change-without-being-an-active-part-of-the-community) regarding changes submitted by non-community members.

## How does it work?
All community projects are publicly discussed. Whenever tasks are decided upon, they are assigned to one of the following teams:

1) Admins Team
2) Automation Team
3) Code review Team
4) Dev Team (Development Team)
5) Docs Team (Documentation Team)
6) Graphic Design Team
7) Sound Design Team

Whoever is available in the appropriate team can pick up the task and work further on it.

When working on a task, be sure to read the relevant [Contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) found in each project for details of any specific requirements.

### Ok, but what if I want to do a change without being an active part of the community?
If a prospective contributor is not part of the community and still wants to take a task, just tag the corresponded issue, so that the community members know you are working on it. Fork the repo; do your changes following the contributing guide; then submit a PR for review. Before opening a PR make sure your changes pass the old tests. Please also ensure that tests are added/updated as part of the contribution to enable ongoing verification of these changes.

## How to submit my old code?
Read the instructions in the [Example Repository here](https://github.com/RISC-OS-Community/ExampleRepository)

## How do to join?
Have a look at the [How to Join](./CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-join-this-community) section in the [Contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

The Contributing document can be found also on each project repository as well. 

Before deciding to join or to contribute, please make sure you have read and accept our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which we all have to follow to ensure a safe and happy community :)

Thanks for reading and for your interest in Open Source and RISC OS!
